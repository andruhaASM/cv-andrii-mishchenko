I":<p> As an experienced software developer, I have played an instrumental role in implementing and maintaining a Learning Management System (LMS) for corporate e-learning, which has been built on a microservices architecture on top of Google Cloud Platform. My proficiency in the tech stack, including Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React, has enabled me to deliver a high-quality product that meets the specific needs of the client.</p>
<p> The LMS offers a range of features designed to enhance the learning experience. For instance, it enables the tracking of learning progress, content curation for personalized learning, and federated search using the Algolia tool. I take pride in having been involved in developing these features, which have played a crucial role in ensuring the LMS's success.</p>
<p> Moreover, as the team leader, I have managed and motivated a team of 4 individuals, including 2 back-end engineers, 1 front-end engineer, and 1 QA analyst. Our collaborative efforts have been critical in achieving our objectives and exceeding the client's expectations.</p>
