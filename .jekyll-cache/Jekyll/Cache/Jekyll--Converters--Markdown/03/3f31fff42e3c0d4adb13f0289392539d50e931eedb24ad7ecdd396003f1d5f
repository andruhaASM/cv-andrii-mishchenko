I"<p> I am proud to have been part of a team of developers that were hired by the Government of The Santa Catarina State to develop a system that enables the provision of Public Defensor services even during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p> The system has several vital features, including the collection and processing of PII data, scheduling of visits and face-to-face meetings, and automatic sending of confirmation emails and notifications. These features have been pivotal in enabling the Public Defensor services to continue uninterrupted despite the pandemic.</p>
<p> As a developer, I utilized my technical prowess to develop the entire application using Django and Postgresql on the back-end and HTML, CSS, and JS on the front-end. I am proud to have contributed my skills and expertise to this project, which has played a crucial role in fighting the spread of the virus through technology. The satisfaction of making a difference through my work motivates me to continue delivering top-quality solutions that have a positive impact on society.</p>
