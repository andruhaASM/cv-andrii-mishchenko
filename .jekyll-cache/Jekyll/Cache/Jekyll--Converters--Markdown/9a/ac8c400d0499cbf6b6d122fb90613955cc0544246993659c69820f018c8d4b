I"¸<p> As a skilled software developer, I have spearheaded the creation and maintenance of a data collection system that caters to the beauty market. This system collects vital data about a person's skin and the cosmetic products they use, leveraging the insights to create a personalized experience that meets the user's specific needs.</p>
<p> My technical prowess was essential in developing the main features of the system. For instance, I implemented logic-enabled questions that dynamically generate the next question based on the user's previous choice. I achieved this using a REST API built on the Django Framework, which has significantly enhanced the system's functionality. Additionally, I integrated the payment system with Stripe, a leading payment platform, enabling seamless transactions for the users.</p>
<p> The technology stack used for developing the system includes the Django REST Framework, HTML, CSS, and JS. The system is deployed on GCP, ensuring it is scalable, reliable, and secure. I take pride in having been a crucial part of the team that delivered this cutting-edge product, which has revolutionized the beauty industry by providing personalized experiences for the users.</p>
