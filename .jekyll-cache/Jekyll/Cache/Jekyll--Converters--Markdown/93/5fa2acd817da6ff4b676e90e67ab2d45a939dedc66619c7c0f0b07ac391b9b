I"q<p> As an accomplished software developer, I have gained extensive practical experience in deploying and integrating applications on AWS and Azure. I have leveraged this experience in the development and maintenance of a system that processes geospatial data collected from agricultural vehicles.</p>
<p> The system utilizes physical sensors connected to a small microprocessor device that enables them on the agricultural vehicle. Once the device connects to the internet, the data collected is uploaded to AWS Storage Buckets, and Azure Blob Storage where a chain of Lambda functions processes and extracts the data. The data is then saved in Postgresql database hosted on Azure, and presented in a visual form for the end-user.</p>
<p> My technical expertise on the back-end includes AWS, Azure, Python, and Postgresql, which has been instrumental in ensuring the system's success. I have worked collaboratively with other developers and stakeholders to ensure that the system meets the user's requirements and provides the necessary functionalities. Specifically, I have been responsible for deploying and integrating the application on both AWS and Azure, ensuring seamless functionality between the two cloud platforms.</p>
<p> On the front-end, I have utilized my proficiency in Angular, which has been instrumental in delivering a user-friendly interface that enables users to interact with the system and extract valuable insights from the geospatial data. I take pride in having been involved in the development of this cutting-edge system that has revolutionized the agriculture industry by providing valuable insights for the users.</p>
